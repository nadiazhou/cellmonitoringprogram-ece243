# Cell Monitoring Program 

`**Final Project ECE243**`

Cell monitoring program including state of charge measurement/algorithm. Calculates energy input/output of an off-board lithium-ion battery cell using voltage and current measurements - obtained from external circuits (probably a shunt for current). Uses the onboard ADC on the NIOS ii processor the analog voltage signals from the sensors into digital values. Displays the results dynamically on graphs to VGA.
